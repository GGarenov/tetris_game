## Usage

After you have installed and built the project, you can play the game by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Here are the controls for the game:

- `Up Arrow`: Rotate the current piece.
- `Left Arrow`: Move the current piece to the left.
- `Right Arrow`: Move the current piece to the right.
- `Down Arrow`: Speed up the drop of the current piece.

The goal of the game is to place the pieces in such a way that they form a complete line across the grid. The completed line will disappear, and you will earn points. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the grid.
